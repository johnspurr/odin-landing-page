# Project: Landing Page

My solution for the [Project: Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) portion of The Odin Project's Foundations course.

The design of this page is based on [a mockup](design-mockup.png), as well as [a styling specification](design-spec.png). Both of these were provided as part of the above-mentioned course.

TODO: 
- Cleanup CSS
    - Split out styling into atomic units?
